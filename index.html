    <h1>Project Information</h1>
    <p>
      I have worked on several projects related to web development, including
      an attendance record system, music player, and todo list application.
      These projects were built using React on the front-end and back-end
      technologies like Node.js and Express.

            The attendance record system was designed to help organizations
            keep track of employee attendance. The system had a user-friendly
            interface that allowed employees to log in and log out, view their
            attendance history, and download their attendance reports. The
            back-end was built with Node.js and Express, and the front-end was
            built with React.

            The music player was designed to allow users to listen to their favorite
            music and create playlists. The music player had a sleek and modern
            design, and it allowed users to search for songs and artists, create and
            edit playlists, and listen to music continuously. The back-end was built
            with Node.js and Express, and the front-end was built with React.

            The todo list application was designed to help users keep track of their
            tasks and manage their schedules. The application had a user-friendly
            interface that allowed users to add and delete tasks, and view their
            task lists. The back-end was built with Node.js and Express, and the
            front-end was built with React.
