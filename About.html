      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Deepak Negi, a trained developer with a passion for creating
        visually appealing and interactive web applications. Over the past few
        years, I have honed my skills in web development, specifically in
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

      <p>
        Recently, I completed a React course, which has expanded my knowledge
        and skillset in creating modern and efficient web applications. During
        the course, I learned about the core concepts of React, such as
        components, states, and props, and how they can be applied to build
        complex user interfaces.

      <h3>Front-end and Back-end Development</h3>
      <p>
        As part of my back-end journey, I have learned and worked with various
        programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and Java, and web
        frameworks such as Django, Ruby on Rails, and Spring Boot. I have also
        gained experience in database management, REST API design, and server
        deployment. As for my front-end journey, I have honed my skills in
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as front-end libraries and
        frameworks such as React and Vue.js. I have learned how to create
        dynamic and interactive user interfaces, integrate APIs, and optimize
        website performance.

      <p>
        To apply my skills in both back-end and front-end development, I have
        worked on various projects that demonstrate my expertise in creating
        full-stack web applications. These projects have included e-commerce
        websites, social media platforms, and content management systems.

      <p>
        Throughout my journey, I have faced various challenges, such as
        debugging complex code, optimizing website performance, and managing
        large datasets. However, each challenge has helped me to grow and
        learn new skills and techniques.
